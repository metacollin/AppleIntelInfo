AppleIntelInfo.kext
===================
### Updated to work with Xeon Scalable CPUs

What do I need to do?

Step 1.) Download the project from Github and compile it with Xcode.

Step 2.) Fix file ownership and permissions.

``` sh
sudo chown -R root:wheel AppleIntelInfo.kext
sudo chmod -R 755 AppleIntelInfo.kext
```

Step 3.) Load AppleIntelInfo.kext?

``` sh
sudo kextload AppleIntelInfo.kext

or with

sudo kextutil AppleIntelInfo.kext 
```
Warning: Do not copy the kext to: /System/Library/Extensions or /Library/Extensions and do not inject it with help of the boot loader!

Step 4.) Unload AppleIntelInfo.kext?

``` sh
sudo kextunload AppleIntelInfo.kext
```

Where can I find the output?


The output of AppleIntelInfo.kext can be found with
``` sh
sudo cat /tmp/AppleIntelInfo.dat
```

Note: This has changed in version 1.2 (data no longer added to /var/log/system.log)
